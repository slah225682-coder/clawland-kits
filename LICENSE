CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 Clawland-AI

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware
designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use,
study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on
those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three
variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W
(weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or
their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.
